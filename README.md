# Performance Optimization in C++

## Description
This project demonstrates performance optimization in C++ by comparing a slow function and its optimized version.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performance_optimization.git
    cd performance_optimization
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./performance_optimization
    ```

## Expected Output
    Slow function time: [time] s
    Optimized function time: [time] s
